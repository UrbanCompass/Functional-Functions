Description: # Functional-Functions
        Created by the FBI Compass team, this package contains our team's most commonly used and useful functions
        
        # About
        Contents include functions for connecting to snowflake, saving and loading pickles. For help with what functions are available, please run help()
        
        # Installation
        To install functional-functions, you can install it using pip:
        ````python
        pip install functional_functions
        ````
        
        # Additional Prequisites
        To use the redshift query connector, you must additionally ensure you have downloaded/installed:
        * Java (Optional)
            * You can usually install that from here: [JDK 16 Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html)
        * JDK8 (Optional)
            * For some reason, you may need this as well? This was troubleshooting I went through for setup
            ````python
            brew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk
            brew install --cask adoptopenjdk8
            ````
        
        
        # Usage
        Currently all files are in the init.py. Import each function as needed. First time users are encouraged to import and run help() for more info.
        
        ````python
        import functional_functions
        ````
        
        ````python
        from functional_functions import help, query_snowflake
        ````
        
        # Troubleshooting/Prequisite/Additional Notes
        Some functions, especially the connections, are built off of a settings.py file which stores local creds. You can view a sample settings file called 'settings.py.sample' in the included files. Obviously feel free to use another method to store and provide creds if you want. We now have added the ability to directly reference environmental variables and/or a .env file. See creds.env.sample for example file.
        
        However if you are using 'settings.py' as your creds file, you will need to place it in your overall site-packages folder. If you are using 'creds.env' you will need to place it in your root folder or have a direct reference to it when you are loading it in. I'd recommend using python package python-dotenv.
        
        **NOTE**: Yes I know code shouldnt be stored in __init__.py, but I also am learning packages and such!.
